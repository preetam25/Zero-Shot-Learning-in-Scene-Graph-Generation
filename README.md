# Zero-Shot-Learning-in-Scene-Graph-Generation

Taking cues from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08319) and the associated [code](https://github.com/yangxuntu/vrd), we exploit techniques of Zero-Shot Learning for Scene Graph Generation. 

1. Training classes from [Visual Relationship Detection](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ranjaykrishna/vrd/) dataset
2. Class embeddings for zero-shot classes from [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/#!) and [GloVe](http://text2vec.org/glove.html)

For details refer to the [presentation](Presentation.pptx) and the [report](Report.pdf).
